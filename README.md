# HD-OG_patched
A Patched version of HD-OG Meta Tags for Joomla 3 with more features.

Please, after install and configure go to https://developers.facebook.com/tools/debug/ and fix/debug your old URL to retrieve new content for Facebook.

HD-OG is a plugin that incorporates Open Graph metadata into your web pages. This is the tag used by Facebook to map and categorize sites on its own social search engine. Metadata includes standard information (such as the page title, type, URL and site name), language information (based on the language used on your site) and a description of the page and image to illustrate the content of the page.

This is a version that was adapted by Ponto Mega for Joomla 3, in addition to making several corrections to the code.
